# Stochastic_Scour_Model
The Stochastic_Scour_Model model is simulated using the R project for statistical computing, R is a language for statistical computing and graphics. R is a free software environment that compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

A detailed presentation of the model is presented in the research paper: "A Stochastic Framework to Investigate the Stability of Bridges Subjected to Local Scour Under a Changing Climate" by Bassel Habeeb, Boulent Imam, Erwan Liberge, Jamie E. Padgett and Emilio Bastidas-Arteaga.

The inputs for the above-mentioned paper are river flow projections under various climate change scenarios, i.e., RCPs 2.6, RCPs 4.5, and RCPs 8.5 from 2011 to 2095. They were produced within the research project IMPACT-2C. Please see the following reference for further details: W. Greuell, J.C.M. Andersson, C. Donnelly, L. Feyen, D. Gerten, F. Ludwig, G.
